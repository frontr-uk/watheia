## v0alpha1 (03/17/2022)

Initial proof of concept. This is just a stable starting point to work
from going forward. It is mostly just a trimmed down version of the stackbit v2 nextjs starter theme.

## v0alpha2 (in progress)

In alpha2 we shall expand on the content model and incorporate a slot-based
layout system for pages and sections.
